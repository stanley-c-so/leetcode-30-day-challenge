// --- Day 22: Subarray Sum Equals K ---

// Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to k.

// Example 1:
// Input:nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
// Output: 2

// Note:
// The length of the array is in range [1, 20,000].
// The range of numbers in the array is [-1000, 1000] and the range of the integer k is [-1e7, 1e7].

// ----------

// to do this in O(n) time you need to use O(n) space. we will keep track of `runningTotal` which is the cumulative sum starting from 0. we maintain a `frequencies` hash table,
// the keys of which represent all unique values of `runningTotal + k` encountered thus far, and the values of which are the frequencies, which is why it is initialized as
// { [k]: 1 }. iterate through the nums of the array. update `runningTotal`, and if it was previously recorded as a possible `target` in our hash table, then we have found x new
// contiguous subarrays if x is the corresponding frequency. then, calculate the current target value of `runningTotal + k` and add that to the hash table.
function solution_1 (nums, k) {
  const frequencies = { [k]: 1 };     // because `runningTotal` begins at 0, and 0 + k = k
  let runningTotal = 0;
  let numArrays = 0;                  // this counter will be the output
  for (const num of nums) {
    runningTotal += num;                                                        // update cumulative `runningTotal`
    if (runningTotal in frequencies) numArrays += frequencies[runningTotal];    // does this match any targets derived from earlier values of `runningTotal`?
    const target = runningTotal + k;                                            // calculate the new `target`
    if (!(target in frequencies)) frequencies[target] = 0;
    frequencies[target]++;                                                      // update the hash map
  }
  return numArrays;
}

// one-liner - basically the above. curiously, if we used the same variable for both `N` and `n` it still works because of scoping rules. note that i couldn't use `|a` at the
// end because of edge case N === [1] and k === 0. since N.map results in an array with a single value, [1], here [1]|0 results in 1, not 0 (coerces to a single character string,
// and '1'|0 --> 1 whereas if the array were longer, '1,2,3,4,5'|0 --> 0. this is our best guess as to how the implicit coercion works. thanks to thomas luo
