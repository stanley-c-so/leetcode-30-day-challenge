// --- Day 26: Longest Common Subsequence ---

// Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

// A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

// If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

// Example 1:

// Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
// Output: 3  
// Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

// Example 2:

// Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

// Example 3:

// Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
// Output: 0
// Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.

// Constraints:

// 1 <= text1.length <= 1000
// 1 <= text2.length <= 1000
// The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

// ----------

// this is similar to levenshtein distance. we will create a dynamic programming table (but we'll only need 2 rows at a time). imagine a grid
// with one string across the top, and another going up and down. imagine this grid is also bounded by 0s along the top and left. each grid position
// represents what the answer would be if each string ended at the point marked out by that position. fill in the grid as follows:
// - if latest letter of both strings match at that position, then it's like you added the same marginal letter to both, so go up left, grab the
//   same result, and add 1
// - else, if they don't match, then take the bigger number between the one above, and the one to the left (because either marginal letter did not
//   change the result)
// the bottom left number is the answer.
